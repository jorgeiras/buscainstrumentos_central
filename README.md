### Project Overview
The BuscaInstrumentos project is designed to aggregate and display information about musical instruments from various online sources. It is composed of the following three parts:
- **Scrapers**: Automated web scrapers that collect data from different websites.
- **Backend**: A Django REST API that processes and serves the scraped data.
- **Frontend**: A React-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the data.

### Repositories
Here are the links to the individual repositories that make up this project:

- **[Backend Repository](#www.github.com/jorgeiras/buscainstrumentos_back)**
- **[Frontend Repository](#www.github.com/jorgeiras/buscainstrumentos_front)**

### Project Goals
The main objectives of the BuscaInstrumentos project include:
- **Showcasing Full-Stack Development Skills**: Building a complete web application from data collection to user interface.
- **Demonstrating DevOps Practices**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and automated deployment.
- **Exploring Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploying the application using cloud services and managing resources efficiently.
- **Developing Data Scraping Techniques**: Automating the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from multiple sources.

### Technical Stack
The project utilizes a range of technologies and tools, including:
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Docker
- **Scrapers**: Python, Scrapy, Selenium, Ansible, Terraform
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Docker, DigitalOcean, Certbot

### Infrastructure and Deployment
The infrastructure for this project is fully automated and cloud-based, leveraging services like DigitalOcean for hosting and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
